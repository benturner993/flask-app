# Objective
The aim for this repository is to create a working prototype flask-app which is to be used in conjunction with the proactive, reactive and win-back modelling strategies.

# Run Configuration

To run the app, please first install and run the `environment.yml` file.

If the app is already running and you need to restart, be sure to first kill the app by running:

- `lsof -i :5000` to find the PID
- `kill -9 PID` where PID is from the command above
